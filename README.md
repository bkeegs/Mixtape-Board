# Mixtape Board
This board is a digital "mixtape," designed to be a compact way to share a music playlist with friends. 
Similar to a cassette, has allure (or disadvantage?) of not knowing what is up next.

Plug-in [HC-06 bluetooth module](http://www.gearbest.com/sensors/pp_241478.html) allows for remote control with an android phone or PC.

Power comes from a rechargeable [18650 Li-ion battery.](https://github.com/bkeegs/18650-Charge-Board) 

Teensy 3.2 is used as the microcontroller.

This board is a work in progress--some circuits have been tested previously, but the full design is currently untested. Now waiting to get boards back from fab.
