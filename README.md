# Mixtape Board
This board is a digital "mixtape," designed to be a compact way to share a music playlist and recordings with friends. 

Similar to a cassette, when given to others it has a surprise factor of not knowing what's up next.

This board is a work in progress--some circuits have been tested previously, but the full design is currently untested. Now waiting to get boards back from fab.

### Main Features:
* Plug-in bluetooth module (like the [HC-06](http://www.gearbest.com/sensors/pp_241478.html) or [CC2540](https://tronixlabs.com.au/breakout-boards/bluetooth/cc2540-serial-bluetooth-v4-0-ble-module-ibeacon-australia/)) allows for remote control with an phone or computer.
* Power comes from a rechargeable [18650 Li-ion battery.](https://github.com/bkeegs/18650-Charge-Board) 
* Teensy 3.2 is used as the microcontroller.
* Audio is single channel, 3W Class-D amplifier using a PAM8009DHR
